Comments go here:
- consider customizing your readme
- maybe contribution guidelines
- how to run it, how to seed it // other general instructions

I like how you linked cards to github issues!

Consider renaming "test" to "reviewing pull requests" or something similarly named (and keep this up to date!)

Make sure you use accurate descriptions to go in more depth about github issues

Title: Add styling to login page
Description: Make the login page header, color red and style the input form fields on top of each other

Commit messages - make sure they are descriptive enough so testers know what to look for when reviewing pull requests

Make a commit when you've finished a small, discrete task AND USE DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGES!!!!!!!

Look into backend protection middleware

make sure you're on the same page about styling (semi-colons, arrow functions, parens, tabs or spaces...etc)

look into prettier - autoformats code on save
